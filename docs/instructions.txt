INTRODUCTION

This package has sources and necessary data files for PNB video game v1.0.1.   

INSTALL

This game utilizes proprietary software FMOD to play audio, so I decided not to make a simple installer. Makefile is included, so you can build and run the game with commands make and ./main, but to do that you need to get necessary libraries. Libraries I needed to download and install were:
FMOD: http://www.fmod.org/
GLEW: http://glew.sourceforge.net/
GLFW: http://www.glfw.org/

Makefile now works for 64-bit system, you have to use different fmod-library for 32-bit system.
